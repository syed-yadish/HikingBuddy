Our goal is to connect people who love hiking and nature and want to share their tips and experiences, get to know each other and organise events. In addition to being able to talk to each other, share images and hiking trails, users will be able to create and join hiking events where they can safely enjoy together amazing moments in nature. For all those passionate about hiking outdoors and active lifestyle this will be the place to be!
